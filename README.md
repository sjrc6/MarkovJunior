# GoresMapJunior
The maps will show up in `output`

## How to build
MarkovJunior interpreter is a console application that depends only on the standard library. Get [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) for Windows, Linux or macOS and run
```
dotnet run --configuration Release MarkovJunior.csproj
```
Alternatively, download and run the latest [release](https://github.com/mxgmn/MarkovJunior/releases) for Windows.

Generated results are put into the `output` folder. Edit `models.xml` to change model parameters. Open `.vox` files with [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/).
